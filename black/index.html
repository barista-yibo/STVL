				<p>Although drought, fire, and erosion continue to decrease good farmland, populations continue
to increase. And because farmers in one area tend to grow the same main crops as everyone
else in that area, prices stay very low. Agrivoltaic systems can double revenue streams,
increase crop value, make the solar output more efficient—all while saving water, meeting
long-term renewable energy goals, and assuring a secure long-term food supply.</p>

				<p>NREL expects that by 2030, utility-scale solar in the usa will
cover almost 2 million acres of land. This offers an
unexpected benefit for farmers. The shade from pv modules
can let farmers grow crops that can't survive or do well in
full sun. They can harvest a more valuable crop from the
same land that gives them additional revenue from their
solar systems. At the same time, growing crops under or
near the modules makes them on average 10% more
efficient. And the environmental benefits can be huge: an
Oregon State University study recently estimated that using
only 1% of American farmland in this way would meet our
renewable energy targets, save immense amounts of water,
and help create a more sustainable, long-term food supply
which—as it is now—can no longer keep up with the world's population.</p>

				<p>Agrivoltaic Systems prevent the competition between
farmers wanting to grow crops and the energy industry
wanting to install more solar modules. Our current
agricultural systems use 70% of the world's freshwater and
cause more than 1/3 of the greenhouse gasses going into
the atmosphere and causing climate change. Our irrigation
systems connected to solar modules can reverse those
negative effects while creating more income for farmers.</p>
				<p>For simple systems you can just connect a rain gutter to the bottom of a ground-mounted solar
array and channel the water into a reservoir connected to our BluSoak line. The water level in
the reservoir only needs to be 5' or 6' above the ground. More complicated and expensive
systems can remotely control the array angles to better harvest rain, protect from hail, or adjust
the amount of sun to match the individual crop's need. Auto-gravity systems in remote areas
can help grow trees on the north side of solar modules and help with more carbon
sequestration, erosion prevention, and food-forest generation.</p>
