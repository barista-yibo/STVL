    <p>During the last year, California (like an increasing number of states) experienced one of the most severe droughts in more than a century. During that time, the second highest use of water was for residential lawns; second only to California's huge agricultural use. In spite of the drought an average Californian household wastes 51% of its water use growing grass, 75,000 gallons a year. Converting to astro turf, a hard surface, or plants that need little or no water, like cactus, maximizes conservation but diminishes aesthetics and carbon sequestration.</p>

    <p>Instead, we can convert lawns to gardens, plant drought-tolerant grass varieties, xeriscape plants, or grow vegetables, herbs, and flowers with rainwater and/or an extreme water-saving irrigation system. You can save up to 25% of your water use just by switching to a drought-tolerant grass type and up to 60% by growing native plants instead of grass. Even growing high water use vegetables and flowers with subsurface irrigation uses a small fraction compared to the water wasted by spraying in the air where it has the highest evaporation to use ratio. For places where you prefer grass for a playground or landscaping aesthetics, we have subsurface irrigation systems for lawns.</p>

    <p>Converting your lawn to a garden can be as complicated and expensive like a professional landscaping renovation; or as simple and inexpensive as placing and planting in fabric beds on top of the grass. In the first year, fabric beds will turn the grass under the bed into a kind of compost pile and during the second year you can cut out or poke holes in the bed bottom so that the roots can grow into the composted grass nutrients. As you have time, you can line the fabric sides with wood, stone, brick, or your artistic preference.</p>
