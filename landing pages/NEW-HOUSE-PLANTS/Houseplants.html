    <span><p>Mistaken watering methods define the main cause for
    houseplants dying. Overwatering remains the main offender
    but of course plants also have problems from not watering
    enough. The slow and automatic water supply from Blumat
    products make it easy to keep your houseplant watering
    levels ideal for each particular plant. They make the
    question, "How often should houseplants be watered?"
    irrelevant. Simple, efficient, and easy to install; your plants
    can take care of themselves while you are on vacation or
    otherwise busy with the rest of your life. If you have a
    Blumat-savy garden store nearby, they may give free
    Blumat Classics when you buy an expensive plant from
    them. It’s a great marketing tool for them because the
    healthier your houseplants stay, the more likely you will be
    to buy more. Short on time, or prefer talking to a human?

    <span><p>An unexpected trip without time to prepare? Time to prepare but
      you forgot about your houseplants? Maybe you don’t feel
      comfortable giving someone you don’t know well the key to your
      house just so they can water your houseplants? Blumat Classics to the rescue! They siphon water from a vase, jar,
      or from anything that holds water into your houseplants for as long
      as the container has water. You can leave for weeks and not worry!
      They also make it much easier to water when you’re at home; just
      fill up the water container. You adjust the amount of water the plant
      receives by lowering or raising the container, you can adjust for
      anything between cactus and tropical plants.</p>

    <h2>Blumat Bottle Adapter</h2>

  <span><p>Bottle adapters don’t look as good as our Glass Globes but
    they’re less expensive and give you a good way to recycle plastic
    bottles. Their tapering, universal tip fits into a wide range of bottle
    sizes, just poke a hole in the bottom to let air in and the
    water slowly out. We usually cut the entire bottom off so you can
    fill them with a watering can. This saves time but also means you will
    need to clean or replace them more often; adding a little hydrogen peroxide once in awhile also helps with cleaning and prevents algae.</p>

  <span><p>Often the best solutions for watering houseplants, these
    hand-blown glass globes look beautiful, make your watering job
    easier, and keep your plants healthy and happy without needing
    electricity, power, batteries, or timers. These glass globes automatically give your
    plants water as needed. They need refilling about every week so
    not as good as Blumat Classics but they make it easy when you’re
    at home or only gone for short trips.</p>

  <span><p>Some plants love misting, thrive with it, don’t do well without it.
    Most of us don’t realize how much it can save water and
    help plants through heat spells. Plants use transpiration and
    evaporation to keep cool which takes lots of the plant's work and time. Misting plants during hot spells helps them with that job and also saves water.</p>

  <span><p>Bonsai - both indoor and outdoor - represent some of the most
    difficult watering challenges. Small pots without much soil holding
    big roots means we don’t have much watering flexibility. These
    small trees have a very hard time with either too much or not
    enough water. Our Bonsai Watering Kits solve these problems
    and give you more time for the more artistic bonsai projects like
    wiring and trimming.</p>
