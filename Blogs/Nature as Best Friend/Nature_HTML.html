<p>Technology brings greater convenience, comfort, capacity, and access to both necessities and frivolous luxuries. Technology also tends to isolate and alienate us from the natural world. In our narrow pursuits of fame, fortune, pleasure, and power; we too easily miss the sun glancing off a colorful flower, the new spring shoots sprouting in the back yard or along the sidewalk, the shimmering leaves glowing in a light rain. Seduced by the constant lure of our cell phones, apps, social media messages, and journalistic sensationalism; we too easily miss the wonders of nature surrounding us.

<p>
   When we overlook that organic perception of wonder and sacredness, we squander the awareness of our basic and innate respect and appreciation; It becomes too easy to sacrifice the long-term health of our planet for the short-term advantages to our materialistic consumerism.
</p>
<br/>
<p>Technology has given advertising experts nuclear level tools in their quest to manipulate us into buying so much that harms the environment while also wasting our financial resources on unnecessary and harmful products. The core ploy in this marketing strategy often focuses on convincing us that we have a problem, we can't be happy with what we have, we will only overcome our dissatisfaction and unhappiness by buying a product or paying for a service.

<p>Connecting with nature in any of a thousand ways undermines this false belief system. We recognize our basic goodness by seeing it in the natural world. And when that happens, people naturally want to protect instead of pollute nature, save our precious water instead of wasting and contaminating it, safeguard our forests, rivers, farmlands, and neighborhoods instead of sacrificing them for short-term, unnecessary profits.</p>
<br>
<p>For most, gardening exemplifies one of the best and most easily accessible ways to nurture this culture-changing attitude. By planting something instead of numbing out with binge watching TV and movies, we can dissolve the false advertising narrative about who and what we really are. Even just taking care of one houseplant can animate this connection with our deeper selves. It can inspire an emotional connection and realization of how much plants and animals share our yearning to live and thrive.</p>

<p>For the immense climate and social problems we face, we too easily blame corrupt politicians, industry science, and business leaders. This only leads to apathy and inaction. Instead, as we like to quote Paolo Lugari, “The only deserts are deserts of the imagination.” We need to make progress on the personal level first. That can overcome our environmental inertia and start some momentum going in the right direction. We can envision and nurture a progression from taking care of a houseplant to changing votes on environmental legislation. When people love a plant, they more easily vote for preserving the natural world.

<p>Nature shows us reality and undermines political propaganda, nationalistic and selfserving delusions. The earthworms, bugs, birds, and breezes speak to us. As Kahlil Gibran writes, “Forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair.”</p>
