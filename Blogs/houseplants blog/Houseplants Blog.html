<h2 style="text-align:center;">On the road again?</h2>
<br>
<p>As the days of summer begin to wind down and the last chances to travel shrink before another school year starts, you may start to wonder how to best keep your houseplants alive while you're on the road. You can ask a neighbor or friend to do this while you're gone but you may not feel confident in their watering skills. You may not know them well enough to give them a key to your home. Blumat houseplant watering products give you personal control.
</p>
<br>
<p>When you're back home again, these time-saving products also keep your plants more healthy. You can trace most houseplant failures to over-watering, but of course they also die when they don't get enough water. Blumats help you keep the moisture levels in just the right range; very little for cactus and succulents, a lot for tropical plants, and everything in between depending on the particular plant.

<p>Based on how long you will be gone, the type of plant, and how large they are; different products work best. Small plants and for times without anyone there to refill the container, <span><a href="/gardening/blumats-for-houseplants/bottle-adaptors">Bottle Adapters</a></span> and <span><a href="/gardening/blumats-for-houseplants/glass-globes">Glass Globes</a></span> most easily help out. For small plants when you won't be home for more than a week, use <span><a href="/gardening/blumats-for-houseplants/blumat-classics">Blumat Classics</a></span>. If you have a row of plants, instead of needing several water containers, you can use our <span><a href="/blumat-junior-extend-a-kit">Extend-a-Kit</a></span> and for rows of larger plants,use the <span><a href="/Houseplant-Vacation-Kit">Houseplant Vacation Kit</a></span>. This new product self-waters 10-12 large plants and keeps them well-watered for 2 weeks or more while you to on vacation, and because they need more water than small plants, they also save you a huge amount of time when you're at home. You can water the plants close together or when they are far apart. Use the <span><a href="/Houseplant-Vacation-Kit">Large Houseplant Vacation Kit</a></span> if you have good light in a room with a bathtub, you can hook this system up to a showerhead and keep plants safely watered for weeks, even months.</p>

<p>If you have a garden store or a nursery that sells houseplants, giving a Blumat to your customers when they buy an expensive plant could be a very profitable investment. It's a great marketing tool because the healthier their plants stay, the more likely they will want to buy more. The Blumats will insure they don't make the very common watering mistakes that typically kill plants and, at the same time, keep them vibrantly healthy and growing fast.</p>
