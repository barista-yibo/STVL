<p>The agricultural lobby became the most powerful lobby in the U.S. Much like the old Tobacco and the current coal lobbys hides and distorts many of the statistics.This vast system of factory farming now produces at least 1/3 of all human caused greenhouse gases. It contaminates our air and water, damages our soil, destroys wildlife habitats, and escalates climate change. Partly because of very little regulation, we can blame our agricultural system for generating as much emissions as 143 million cars annually.
</p>
<br>
<p>Much more like a factory than a farm, these gigantic organizations make $116 billion in annual profits, are one of the largest sources of water, air, and greenhouse gas pollution, with congressional enablers siting on both sides of the political spectrum.
</p>
<br>
<p>The way we plough and till releases carbon dioxide from the soil. The most common ways we fertilize release large amounts of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. Methane and wastes from cows and other farm animals often contaminate local rivers, lakes, and public water supplies. The world's cattle became (after China) the second biggest source of the world's pollution. Congress recently amended the law so that animal factories don't have to report the pollution they're creating
</p>
<br>
<p>The <cite>World Wildlife Fund</cite> reported that in 2019, more than 2.6 million acres of grasslands that were storing greenhouse gases became farmland that produced more instead of less pollution. However, most protest groups only spend 1-2% of their budgets fighting agricultural pollution.

<p>Some of the main challenges we face in creating a truly Regenerative Agriculture include how to save water without increasing pollution from drip and tape system waste, how to evolve irrigation systems without decreasing jobs, and how to this without increasing food costs.
</p>
<br>
<p>But we have good news too!
Our Root Demand Subsurface irrigation systems can last for decades while saving huge percentages of water while growing more healthy and vigorous plants.

<h2>Root Demand Irrigation</h2>
<h3><a href="https://www.sustainablevillage.com/subsurface-irrigation">Subsurface systems without the high cost, waste, or extra work</a>
</h3>
<p>These systems save so much water and last so long because the irrigation soaker tape rests deep enough  that plows and cultivation tools don't bother it. It automatically gives much more water the first two weeks while the hydrophilic film swells. This can often supply enough water for seeds and small plants until their roots grow deep enough to control the amount of water released. In drier or hotter areas though, it could be best to use a <a href="https://www.sustainablevillage.com/farms/Kifco-Ag-Reels/water-reels?page=1">Kifco Water Wheel</a> for the first few weeks.
